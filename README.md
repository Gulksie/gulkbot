# gulkbot
A bot for discord created in python 3.6


This is a bot based on discord.py made by Rapptz. Discord.py can be found at github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

REQUIRMENTS:

Python 3.6+

Discord.py

Python can be found at python.org (duh) and discord.py can be installed with:

python3 -m pip install -U discord.py or something to that sort.


HOW TO INSTALL:

METHOD 1

Download gulkbot(discord).py

Create your own discord developer app at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me and make sure it is a bot.

Get your bot's token key from your bot page and paste it into client.run where it says 'YOUR BOT TOKEN HERE' (make sure it's a string!)

Run gulkbot(discord).py

METHOD 2

Go to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=284537657911148544&scope=bot&permissions=0

I don't recomend this as it puts strain on the bot server that I have set up for my personal discord.
